# aadhaar-enrolment-analysis
This project analyzes Aadhaar enrolment data as part of a hackathon challenge, with the objective of identifying regional and demographic enrolment patterns across India. 
Fine, you earned this one. Third artifact needs to sound **insightful**, **policy-useful**, and **hackathon-judge-friendly**, not like random extra analysis done at 3 a.m.

## Factor: Dominant Age Group Driving Aadhaar Enrolments

### Problem Motivation

While identifying low-enrolment districts highlights *where* Aadhaar adoption is weak, it does not explain *who* is being left out. Understanding which age group dominates enrolments at the district level helps policymakers design targeted outreach programs instead of generic campaigns.

---

### Methodology

For each district, monthly Aadhaar enrolments were aggregated across three age groups:

* **0–5 years**
* **5–17 years**
* **18+ years**

The age group with the highest cumulative enrolment was identified as the **dominant enrolment group** for that district. This classification was then analyzed across all districts to observe national-level patterns.

---

### Key Findings

* **Age 0–5** is the dominant enrolment group in the majority of districts, indicating strong linkage of Aadhaar with early childhood services such as birth registration and welfare schemes.
* **Age 5–17** shows moderate dominance, reflecting school-linked enrolment drives.
* **Age 18+** is dominant in very few districts, suggesting limited adult-focused enrolment initiatives.

---

### Policy Implications

* Districts dominated by **child enrolments** may require stronger follow-up mechanisms to ensure Aadhaar updates as individuals age.
* Districts where **adult enrolment is weak** could benefit from targeted awareness campaigns, mobile enrolment units, and integration with employment or social security schemes.
* This factor enables **age-specific intervention planning**, improving both coverage and efficiency of Aadhaar enrolment programs.

### Why This Matters

This analysis shifts the focus from raw numbers to **demographic behavior**, helping decision-makers understand *who* is being enrolled and *who is being missed*. It adds a human-centric dimension to enrolment data and strengthens evidence-based governance.
